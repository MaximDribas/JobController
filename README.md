# TaskList new

This is a basic TODO-style task management application with both console and web user interface (that available via link after application started ). Its main - and only - purpose is to provide a playground for applying new techniques and knowledge which I obtained while studying Java. As such, this application could have been written using much less lines of code - but in this case ”a little bit” bloated” code base was not the primary concern. Objective was to try modular approach in software application design and to master dependency injection techniques in order to achieve higher flexibility and re-usability of the code like Enterprise style.

# Functionality:

Basic CRUD operations for user-provided TODO items

# Backlog:

Send email-notifications to user about upcoming TODO events (using scheduling via cron expressions)

# Currently used software stack:

- Java 8
- Spring boot + Spring MVC
- HTML + Thymeleaf
- JUnit + Mockito + MockMvc + Mutational testing
- Git
- Maven
- Hibernate (using H2 in-memory database)
